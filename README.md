# @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x

React Native Client for `@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x`
Provides endpoints to manage your Kinde Businesses

> Functions/methods targeting the Management API can only be accessed with tokens generated by the Client Credentials Auth flow at the moment. Since this SDK does not support the Client Credential flow, Management API functions are not available for use. In the future, tokens obtained via other flows would also be able to access the management API functions/methods.

We only support the recommended [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).
For more information, please visit [https://kinde.com/docs](https://kinde.com/docs)

## Support Versions

-   React Native: 0.50 -> 0.59

## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).

Follow [the installation instructions for your chosen OS](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/0.50/getting-started) to install dependencies;

## Installation

The SDK can be installed with `npm` or `yarn` but we will use `npm` for code samples.

```shell
npm install @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x --save
```

Also, we're using the [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) to store your sensitive data. After successfully installing the SDK, you need to link the package to the SDK:

```shell
npx react-native link react-native-keychain
```

### Android

Checking `MainApplication.java` to verify the package was added

### iOS

If `react-native-keychain` not linked, you need to install it manually.
- Click to `Build Phases` tab
- Choose `Link Binary With Libraries`
- Click `+` in bottom
- **Add Other...** => ***Add Files...*** => ***node_modules/react-native-keychain/RNKeychain.xcodeproj***
- Then, you need to add `libRNKeychain.a`
- Clean and rebuild

## Getting Started

### Kinde configuration

On the Kinde web app navigate to `Settings` in the left menu, then select `Applications` and select the `Frontend app`. Scroll down to the `Callback URLs` section.

Here you want to put in the callback URLs for your React Native app, which should look something like this:

-   Allowed callback URLs - `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback`
-   Allowed logout redirect URLs - `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback`

Make sure you press the Save button at the bottom of the page!

Note: The `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback` is used as an example of local URL Scheme, change to the local local URL Scheme that you use.

### Environments

If you would like to use our Environments feature as part of your development process. You will need to create them first within your Kinde account. In this case you would use the Environment subdomain in the code block above.

### Configuring your app

#### Environment variables

Put these variables in your .env file. You can find these variables on the same page as where you set the callback URLs.

-   `KINDE_ISSUER_URL` - your Kinde domain
-   `KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL` - After the user authenticates we will callback to this address. Make sure this URL is under your allowed callback URLs
-   `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` - where you want users to be redirected to after logging out. Make sure this URL is under your allowed logout redirect URLs
-   `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` - you can find this on the App Keys page

```javascript
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com
KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL=myapp://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=myapp://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
```

### Configuration Deep link

If your app was launched from an external url registered to your app you can access and handle it from any component you want with:

```javascript
...
import { ..., Linking, Platform, ... } from 'react-native';
...

componentDidMount() {
    Linking.getInitialURL()
      .then((url) => {
        if (url) {
          // Your code here
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error("An error occurred", err));
  Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
      if (event.url) {
        // Your code here
      }
    })
}
```

#### iOS

On iOS, you'll need to link `RCTLinking` to your project by following the steps described here. If you also want to listen to incoming app links during your app's execution, you'll need to add the following lines to your `AppDelegate.m`

```swift
// iOS 9.x or newer
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
   openURL:(NSURL *)url
   options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}
```

If you're targeting iOS 8.x or older, you can use the following code instead:

```swift
// iOS 8.x or older
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url
                      sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
}
```

Please make sure you have configuration URL scheme in `Info.plist`, so app can be opened by deep link:

```swift
...
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Editor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>myapp</string> // you can change it
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>myapp</string> // you can change it
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
...
```

#### Android

Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and update your scheme:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="myapp" android:host="your_kinde_issuer.kinde.com" />  // you can change it
</intent-filter>
```

### Integration your app

Youâ€™ll need to create a new instance of the Kinde Auth client object. Please execute this code below:

```javascript
...
import { KindeSDK } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x';
...

...
state = {
  ...
  client: new KindeSDK(
    YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
    YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
    YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
    YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI
  )
  ...
}
...
```

### Login / Register

The Kinde client provides methods for an easy to implement login / register flow.
As an example if you add buttons in your render as follows:

```javascript
<View>
    <View>
        <Button title="Sign In" onPress={this.handleSignIn} />
    </View>
    <View>
        <Button title="Sign Up" color="#000" onPress={this.handleSignUp} />
    </View>
</View>
```

Then define new functions that match for each button:
**\*Note**: Make sure you've already defined KindeSDK as `client` in the state\*

```javascript
...
constructor() {
  ...
  this.handleSignUp = this.handleSignUp.bind(this);
  this.handleSignIn = this.handleSignIn.bind(this);
  ...
}

handleSignUp() {
  this.state.client.register();
}

handleSignIn() {
  this.state.client.login();
}
...
```

### Handle redirect

Once your user is redirected back to your app from Kinde, using the `getToken` method to get token instance from Kinde

```javascript
...
constructor() {
  ...
  this.handleCallback = this.handleCallback.bind(this);
  ...
}
...
componentDidMount() {
  Linking.getInitialURL()
    .then((url) => {
      if (url) {
        this.handleCallback(url);
      }
    })
    .catch((err) => console.error("An error occurred", err));

  Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
    if (event.url) {
      this.handleCallback(event.url);
    }
  })
}

async handleCallback(url) {
  const token = await this.state.client.getToken(url);
  console.log('token here', token);
}
```

You can also get the current authentication status with `authStatusConstants`:

```javascript
...
import {..., authStatusConstants ,...} from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x';
...

...

async handleCallback(url) {
  if (this.state.client.authStatus !== authStatusConstants.UNAUTHENTICATED) {
    const token = await this.state.client.getToken(url);
    console.log('token here', token);
  }
}
```

Or simply use `isAuthenticated` from the SDK to determine whether the user is authenticated or not:

```javascript
async handleCallback(url) {
  if (await this.state.client.isAuthenticated) {
    const token = await this.state.client.getToken(url);
    console.log('token here', token);
  }
}
```

### Logout

This is implemented in much the same way as logging in or registering. The Kinde SPA client comes with a logout method

```javascript
...
constructor() {
  ...
  this.handleLogout = this.handleLogout.bind(this);
  ...
}
...

handleLogout() {
  ...
  this.state.client.logout();
  ...
}
```

### Get user information

**\*Note warning:** Before you call the API, please make sure that you've already authenticated. If not, errors will appear there.\*

To access the user information, use the `OAuthApi`, `ApiClient` classes exported from `@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x`, then call the `getUser` method of `OAuthApi` instance

```javascript
...
import { ..., OAuthApi, ApiClient, ... } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-5x';
...

state = {
  ...
  apiClient: new ApiClient(YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER),
  ...
}
...
constructor() {
  ...
  this.getUserProfile = this.getUserProfile.bind(this);
  ...
}
...



async getUserProfile() {
  const apiInstance = new OAuthApi(this.state.apiClient)
  const data = await apiInstance.getUser();
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}

```

### View users in Kinde

If you navigate to the "Users" page within Kinde you will see your newly registered user there. ðŸš€

### User Permissions

Once a user has been verified as login in, your product/application will be returned the JWT token with an array of permissions for that user. You will need to configure your product/application to read permissions and unlock the respective functions.

You set Permissions in your Kinde account (see help article), the below is an example set of permissions.

```javascript
const permissions = [
    'create:todos',
    'update:todos',
    'read:todos',
    'delete:todos',
    'create:tasks',
    'update:tasks',
    'read:tasks',
    'delete:tasks'
];
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions:

```javascript
await this.state.client.getPermission('create:todos');
// {orgCode: "org_1234", isGranted: true}

await this.state.client.getPermissions();
// {orgCode: "org_1234", permissions: ["create:todos", "update:todos", "read:todos"]}
```

A practical example in code might look something like:

```javascript
const permission = await this.state.client.getPermission('create:todos');
if (permission.isGranted) {
    // show Create Todo button in UI
}
```

### Audience

An `audience` is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde client to request an audience be added to the provided token.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token.

```javascript
...
state = {
  ...
  client: new KindeSDK(
    YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
    YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
    YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
    YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
    YOUR_SCOPES,
    {
      audience: 'api.yourapp.com'
    }
  )
  ...
}
...
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/register-an-api/)

### Overriding scope

By default the KindeSDK SDK requests the following scopes:

-   profile
-   email
-   offline
-   openid

You can override this by passing scope into the KindeSDK

```javascript
...
state = {
  ...
  client: new KindeSDK(
    YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
    YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
    YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
    YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
    "profile email offline openid"
  )
  ...
}
...
```

### Getting claims

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your id or access tokens. The helper defaults to access tokens:

```javascript
await this.state.client.getClaim('aud');
// ["api.yourapp.com"]

await this.state.client.getClaim('given_name', 'id_token');
// "David"
```

### Organizations Control

#### Create an organization

To have a new organization created within your application, you will need to run a similar function to below:

```javascript
<Button title="Create Organization" onPress={this.handleCreateOrg} />
```

Then define new function that match for button:
**\*Note**: Make sure you've already defined KindeSDK as `client` in the state\*

```javascript
...
constructor() {
  ...
  this.handleCreateOrg = this.handleCreateOrg.bind(this);
  ...
}

handleCreateOrg() {
  this.state.client.createOrg();
}

// You can also pass org_name as your organization
this.state.client.createOrg({org_name: 'Your Organization'});
...
```

#### Sign in and sign up to organizations

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. Youâ€™ll have to pass this code through when you register a new user. Example function below:

```javascript
this.state.client.register({ org_code: 'your_org_code' });
```

If you want a user to sign in into a particular organization, pass this code along with the sign in method.

```javascript
this.state.client.login({ org_code: 'your_org_code' });
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the org_code and the permissions for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each). Example of a returned token:

```json
{
    "aud": [],
    "exp": 1658475930,
    "iat": 1658472329,
    "iss": "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
    "jti": "123457890",
    "org_code": "org_1234",
    "permissions": ["read:todos", "create:todos"],
    "scp": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline"],
    "sub": "kp:123457890"
}
```

The id_token will also contain an array of Organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example.

```json
{
  ...
  "org_codes": ["org_1234", "org_4567"]
  ...
}
```

There are two helper functions you can use to extract information:

```javascript
await this.state.client.getOrganization();
// {orgCode: "org_1234"}

await this.state.client.getUserOrganizations();
// {orgCodes: ["org_1234", "org_abcd"]}
```

## Token Storage

Once the user has successfully authenticated, you'll have a JWT and possibly a refresh token that should be stored securely.

## How to run test

The simplest way to run the JavaScript test suite is by using the following command at the root of your React Native checkout:

```bash
npm test
```

_Note: Ensure you have already run `npm install` before_

## General tips

Sometimes there will be issues related to caching when you develop React Native.
There are some recommendations for cleaning the cache:

1. Remove `node_modules`, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`
2. Clean cache: `yarn cache clean` or `npm cache clean --force`
3. Make sure you have changed values in `.env` file
4. Trying to install packages again: `yarn install` or `npm install`
5. Run Metro Bundler: `yarn start --reset-cache` or `npm start --reset-cache`

Assume your project path is `<StarterKit_PATH>`.

##### With Android:

1. Clean cache:

```bash
cd <StarterKit_PATH>/android./gradlew clean
```

2. Follow the steps in the above `General tips`.

##### With iOS:

1. Follow the steps at the above `General tips`.
2. Clean cache:

```bash
cd <StarterKit_PATH>/rm -rf Pods && rm -rd Podfile.lock
```

3. Clean build folders on Xcode.
